Security Features Implemented:

1.Ensuring Password Security:

Bcrypt Hashing: To ensure the security of user passwords we utilize the bcrypt algorithm for robust password hashing. This recognized method provides cryptographic strength, in password protection.

Salt Generation: For added security, against rainbow table attacks Bcrypt automatically generates salts for each password. This significantly enhances the security measures in place.

2.Password Complexity Criteria:

Complexity Validation: To ensure the security of your password certain complexity criteria need to be met. These criteria include checking for a length the presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

Client-Side Validation: Validation, on the Users End; Before encrypting and saving passwords our system verifies their complexity to minimize the risk of passwords.

3.Interacting with a Secure Database:

SQLite Database: Our system utilizes a database to store user data. This choice ensures that we have an lightweight method of managing user information.

Prevention of SQL Injection: To safeguard against SQL injection attacks we employ queries. This security measure helps protect our system from web vulnerabilities.

4.Record keeping:

Error and Access Logging: The system keeps track of activities and errors which's essential, for monitoring and identifying potential security concerns.

5.Dealing with Errors:

Robust Error Management: A focus, on error management; The application has implemented efficient error handling mechanisms to effectively handle and record exceptions especially when it comes to database operations. This does not improve the reliability of the system. Also enhances its security.

6.Security of the User Interface:

Notifying Users about Authentication Failures: The system offers users feedback when their login attempts fail such, as due, to credentials while safeguarding against disclosing information that could potentially assist malicious activities.
