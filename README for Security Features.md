Security Features Implemented:

1.Ensuring Password Security:

Bcrypt Hashing: To ensure the security of user passwords we utilize the bcrypt algorithm for robust password hashing. This recognized method provides cryptographic strength, in password protection.

Salt Generation: For added security, Bcrypt automatically generates salts for each password. This significantly enhances the security measures in place.

2.Password Complexity Criteria:

Complexity Validation: To ensure the security of your password certain complexity criteria need to be met. These criteria include checking for a length the presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

Validation on the Users End: Before encrypting and saving passwords our system verifies their complexity to minimize the risk of passwords.

3.Interacting with a Secure Database:

SQLite Database: Our code utilizes a database to store user data. This choice ensures that we have an easy method of managing user information.

SQL attack prevention: To safeguard against SQL attacks we employed queries. This security measure helps protect our system from web vulnerabilities.

4.Record keeping:

Error and Access Logging: The code keeps track of activities and errors which is essential, for monitoring and identifying potential security concerns.

5.Dealing with Errors:

Error Management: A focus, on error management; The code has implemented efficient error handling mechanisms to effectively handle and record exceptions especially when it comes to database operations. This does not improve the reliability of the system. Also enhances its security.

6.Security of the User Interface:

Notifying Users about Authentication Failures: The code offers users feedback when their login attempts fail such, as due, to credentials while safeguarding against disclosing information that could potentially assist malicious activities.
